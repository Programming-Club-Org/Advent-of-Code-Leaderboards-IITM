This directory is for the person from Programming Club IITM who will be updating this.
It contains a few reusable files and a few instructions.

Update your name here \:)

2025 - [ScepticallySam](https://github.com/ScepticallySam)

Steps to follow:

1. Check if the previous year's leaderboard is "irrevocably obliterated" or not.
2. If not make sure it's archived here and mention your name once you archive it.
    1. To archive it just download the page. Download it from your personal account since the admin account might leave loopholes in the downloaded page.
    2. Add the html file to a folder with the year in this repo.
    3. Change the hrefs that use `./<your download name>/` to `../css/`
    4. ~~If anything goes wrong go to gpt sama or contact a person who knows html~~
3. Now make a new folder for the current year and copy the contents to `currently_ongoing.html` in this directory just changing the year.
4. Make a fresh leaderboard. Since the leaderboard person limit is capped at 200, we need to make new ones everytime.
4. After the event is done make sure you add the leaderboard's archive in the repo as mentioned in step 2. 
5. You can choose to "irrevoably obliterate" the leaderboard or leave it in the hands of next year's AoC dude (prefarably the latter ig).
5. Check if anything is breaking, otherwise, you are good to go \:)
